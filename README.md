# API_and_ESP32
This is one of the activities that I produce in the first days of university of computer engeneering and my personal fist takes on ESP32.
Basically consist in a circuit that displays temperature and humidity based on the capture of information provided by OpenWether API, with that we can create a simple "weather channel".
